* S3 Backups
    - Daily Snapshots: A Jenkins Job launch an AMI backup (no reboot) of all production instances
    - Daily Backups: A scheduled job launch a rails task which uses the backup utility to dump the mariadb and redis databases. The utility also send the dumps to S3.
* Deployment
    Deployment is made through Jenkins (job codepicnic.com) which in turn uses recap/capistrano to deploy the rails application. "ubuntu" is the deployment user, and "codepicnic" is the application user.
